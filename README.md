It is a Spring MVC web application. I developed this CRM to better understand the working of backend MVC architecture that performs CRUD operations.
This allows us to add, update and delete customer details. It displays the list of customers in sorted fashion.
I’m working on adding more features like (Search bar), displaying sorted list on demand.
I’ve used Spring core principles like Dependency Injection, MVC pattern to write business logics and Hibernate to integrate with MySQL.
Tech stack used : Spring MVC, Hibernate, MySQL, JSP
